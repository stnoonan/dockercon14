## RedHat EVP/CTO Brian Stevens

Technical difficulties for first 5 minutes.

Presentation with reveal.js!

13 years at RedHat

100x advantage to replace previous standard

Infrastructure plumbers -> building houses (Project Atomic)

The journey to containers for RedHat started with SELinux and an NSA contract.
Once Google released cgroups, RedHat immediately recognized  the usefulness.

### Project Atomic (http://www.projectatomic.io/)

Targeted for container based deployments, image based updates, rollback

Facilities for managing containers (GearD)

  * Bridging systemd to containers/Docker

Sounds a lot like CoreOS but run by RedHat

Source -> container + Container wiring (networking)

Dynamic DNS is hard

Cockpit GUI for managing containers

  * Atomic installation is 321 packages versus 1419 for Fedora
    * Though uh, he does have a whole GUI installed on Fedora
  * WebUI (Cockpit) uses journald to show live logs
  * Resource monitoring by container
  * Dynamic resource limits
  * Marketing point is '200+ kernel committers'


Cynical aside: node + mongo + load balancer not for reliability,
        but because they have to?

Demo using Apache JMeter + automatically discovered services that
are added to haproxy config.
