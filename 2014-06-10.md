# Intro Sessions

### Why Docker?
Seth Lochen, Release Engineering Manager at Groupon

Shifted from Rails app to Service Oriented Architecture
Docker enables a standard set of tools for building, testing, and 
dependency management.  Empowers development teams to make their own
choices.

## So what do we do now?
Solomon Hykes, Founder & CTO at Docker

A blueprint for the future - upgrade the internet to use containers.
Clearly no standard interfaces; let's use Docker as a standard interface
for containers.

1. Packaging
1. Sandboxing
1. Orchestration

### Libcontainer announcements

* libcontainer is now a standalone project
* libcontainer now has SELinux and systemd integration
* Google is joining as a core maintainer
* Parallels is contributing a C implementation and OpenVZ support
* Ubuntu and LXC are creating a unified cgroup interface

### Libchan

https://github.com/docker/libchan

* Go channels over the network
* Simple message passing
* Synchronization without sharing state
* Raw socket passing: channels as gateways to any other protocol
* Nesting: channels can send channels

### Libswarm

Shipper, Mesos, etc etc etc etc

minimalist toolkit to compose network service composition

Common interface for all sorts of orchestration pieces
